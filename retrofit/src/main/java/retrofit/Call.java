/**
 * An invocation of a Retrofit method that sends a request to a webserver and returns a response.
 * Each call yields its own HTTP request and response pair. Use {@link #clone} to make multiple
 * calls with the same parameters to the same webserver; this may be used to implement polling or
 * to retry a failed call.
 *
 * <p>Calls may be executed synchronously with {@link #execute}, or asynchronously with {@link
 * #enqueue}. In either case the call can be canceled at any time with {@link #cancel}. A call that
 * is busy writing its request or reading its response may receive a {@link IOException}; this is
 * working as designed.
 *
 * <p>Implementation of {@code toString()} for this interface should never include sensitive data
 * such as query params, headers and so on.
